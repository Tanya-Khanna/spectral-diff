# Spectral Diff — Product Steering

Spectral Diff turns GitHub PR review into a haunted house.
- Each changed file = a room
- Higher risk = darker room
- Diff lines = glowing scratches
- Lantern Mode guides review one hunk at a time

Core rule: every spooky element must improve review speed, focus, or safety.
